# Low Code with Ecosystem Context Solutions
This repository contains a number of solutions that demonstrate the use of ecosystem context or 'contextual data' to deliver low code solutions with better impact, and improved user experience. These solutions have been created as part of a blog series on lowcodelewis.com on using Microsoft Graph with Power Platform.

### Blog Series - Using Microsoft Graph with the Power Platform to build Low Code solutions with Ecosystem Context
On my blog, Low Code Lewis, I have written a series of posts around using Microsoft Graph when building on the Power Platform. The major focus here has been on utilising Ecosystem Context or 'contextual data' to build Low Code solutions that have...
- Improved UX or 'user experience'
- Greater impact and time saving points
- Reduced scope for reinventing the wheel
